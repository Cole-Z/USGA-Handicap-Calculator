Program will allow for handicap index calculation for players based on the number of rounds in the system for that player.

Users can also add additional courses and/or add more players to the list.

Player data and course data is stored in the /bin dir of the project. Everytime a new player is added, it will add that player to the master list, and in order for scores to be calculated, rounds need to be added per player so their scoring list can be generated.
